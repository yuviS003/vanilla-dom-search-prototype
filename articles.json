    "subheading": "Here’s why a new $40,000 electric vehicle tax credit for business owners may be relatively easy to get",
    "articleBody": "Business owners will be able to avail themselves of a new tax credit for electric vehicles starting next year — and it should be easier to get than a similar tax break for consumer households buying “new clean” passenger cars, according to tax and auto experts.\n\nThe Inflation Reduction Act, which President Joe Biden signed into law Aug. 16, created or amended a few tax breaks to incentivize Americans to buy electric cars, trucks and other vehicles. The provisions essentially make the vehicles less expensive for recipients to buy.  \n\nOne of those tax breaks — for “new clean vehicles” — comes with consumer-specific requirements tied to annual income and car-specific requirements around manufacturing, battery-mineral sourcing and retail price.\n\nSome experts think it may be difficult to claim the tax break at first, since many cars may not meet those requirements right away.\n\nBut a second tax break — the “credit for qualified commercial clean vehicles,” for businesses that buy an electric vehicle for commercial purposes — doesn’t carry those requirements.\n\nThat means business owners and the vehicles they buy may qualify for the tax break more easily, experts said.\n\nPlus, the tax credit for bigger trucks is worth more money — up to $40,000 in contrast to the $7,500 maximum for passenger cars and smaller commercial electrics.\n\n“I think it’s going to be a lot more straightforward and easy to take advantage of than the light-duty-vehicle tax credit,” Ingrid Malmgren, policy director at Plug In America, said of the tax credit for commercial EVs. “It’s really a great opportunity for business owners to reduce emissions in a cost-effective way.”\n\nBusiness owners can get the tax credit for new vehicles purchased on or after Jan. 1, 2023. It’s available for 10 years, through the end of 2032.\n\n           Here are the basics of the credit for commercial vehicles.\n\nThe tax break is available to business owners who buy an electric vehicle or electric “mobile machinery,” including for construction, manufacturing, processing, farming, mining, drilling or timbering.\n\nThe vehicle must be subject to a depreciation allowance — meaning it’s for business use, according to the Congressional Research Service.\n\n“If you had a flower shop, for example, and you want to get flower-delivery vehicles, you buy a bunch of vans, you’d be the one claiming the tax credit,” Malmgren said.\n\nThere are two thresholds for the commercial tax credit: Vehicles that weigh less than 14,000 pounds qualify for up to $7,500; those that weigh more than that qualify for up to $40,000.\n\nThe 14,000-pound demarcation line includes commercial vehicles that are Class 4 and above, or largely medium- and heavy-duty trucks and buses.\n\nMedium- and heavy-duty trucks “are the fastest-growing fuel users and greenhouse gas producers in the United States,” according to a 2019 U.S. Department of Energy report.\n\nClass 3 through Class 8 trucks make up less than 5% of the total number of U.S. vehicles on the road but they account for 27% of annual on-road fuel use, according to the report. Gasoline and diesel account for well over 90% of the fuel use for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles, it added.\n\nWhile the market for electrified commercial vehicles has “lagged well behind” that for light-duty vehicles, battery performance has improved and battery costs have fallen substantially over the last decade, making electrification of medium- and heavy-duty trucks and buses “more attractive,” according to the Energy Department report.\n\nTechnically, the commercial-vehicle tax credit is worth the lesser of: (1) 30% of the vehicle purchase price; or (2) the “incremental cost” relative to a similar gasoline-powered vehicle. (The incremental cost is the net difference in price between the commercial clean vehicle and a similar vehicle with an internal combustion engine.)\n\nWhatever the amount from this calculation, its ultimate value is capped at $7,500 or $40,000, as noted earlier.\n\nSome aspects of the tax break will be unclear until the U.S. Department of the Treasury and IRS issue guidance on the new rules, experts said. For example, how will business owners determine the price of a comparable gas-powered vehicle to do an “incremental cost” analysis?\n\nBecause the financial benefit is structured as a tax credit, business owners must have a tax liability to benefit. One caveat: Tax-exempt entities can still get a financial benefit in the form of a direct check from government, said Steven Schmoll, a director at KPMG.\n\nIn addition, business owners can’t double dip by getting a tax break on the consumer side (tax code section 30D) and on the commercial end (code section 45W).\n\nHow commercial, consumer e-vehicle breaks differ\nOne key difference between the commercial and consumer tax credits for new clean vehicles is the absence of manufacturing and other requirements for the commercial credit.\n\nTo be eligible for a “new clean vehicles” credit (i.e., the one that’s not for business owners), final assembly of the car must now occur in North America. The Energy Department has a list of vehicles that meet this standard.\n\nSome additional rules take effect in 2023.\n\nFirst, there are income caps. A tax credit isn’t available to single individuals with modified adjusted gross income of $150,000 and above. The cap is higher for others — $225,000 for heads of household and $300,000 for married couples who file a joint tax return. (The test applies to income for the current or prior year, whichever is less.)\n\nAnd certain cars may not qualify based on price. Sedans with a retail price of more than $55,000 aren’t eligible, nor are vans, SUVs or trucks over $80,000.\n\nTwo other rules apply to manufacturing: One carries requirements for sourcing of the car battery’s critical minerals; the second requires a share of battery components be manufactured and assembled in North America. Consumers lose half the tax credit’s value — up to $3,750 — if one of those requirements isn’t met; they’d lose the full $7,500 for failing to meet both.\n\nThe five requirements were added by the Inflation Reduction Act, and none of them apply to the commercial clean vehicle credit, Schmoll said.",

    "subheading": "Big bargains will dominate the holiday season, but shoppers may not be sold",
    "articleBody": "Grocery and energy prices have spiked, and credit card interest rates are climbing, but shoppers can expect some relief as they start holiday shopping.\n\nRetailers, desperate to coax inflation-fatigued consumers to spend, are expected to beef up promotions as they struggle to get rid of already marked-down excess inventory.\n\n“This will be the year of the perpetual deal for Christmas,” said Marshal Cohen, chief industry advisor for the NPD Group, a market research firm.\n\nIn some gift categories, merchandise could be marked down by more than 20% on retailers’ websites, according to Adobe Analytics, which tracks online sales. Computers, electronics and toys are all expected to hit the deepest discounting levels since Adobe started tracking figures in 2017.\n\nThe abundance of deals is a sharp departure from a year ago. Last holiday season, shoppers started buying gifts early to avoid out-of-stocks and shipping delays. Concerns about not getting hot items meant consumers were willing to pay up.\n\nThis year, though, retailers have an abundance of merchandise. Shoppers are reluctant to spend as they pay more for food, housing, health care and other items as inflation hovers around a four-decade high. People are also spending more on travel and experiences after two-plus years of Covid restrictions.\n\nEven with the bigger discounts, industry watchers expect a muted holiday season because of households’ stretched budgets. Consulting firm Bain & Co. forecasts growth of as much as 7.5% from last holiday season, but when adjusted for inflation, that is only 1% to 3%. Consulting firm Alix Partners projects a 4% to 7% increase in sales year over year — but that is a decline when factoring in the current year-over-year inflation rate of 8.2%.\n\n“It’s food, it’s medical care, it’s housing and shelter costs. It’s essential services such as veterinary care, and child care,” said Leo Feler, chief economist at market researcher Numerator. “All of these things come first before consumers buy holiday gifts.”\n\nPlus, customers may not even want some of the items that retailers are putting on sale. Computers, the category that’s expected to have the highest level of discounting during the holiday season, according to Adobe, has seen cooling demand. HP, Dell and Lenovo have all reported a decline in shipments of personal computers.\n\nThe return of steep discounting will be a tough pill to swallow for companies. It is pressuring retailers’ profit margins, as they juggle higher costs. Already, Walmart\n, Target\n and Best Buy\n have cut their profit outlooks as the retailers navigate a more promotional environment. Walmart leaders have said even higher-income households are trading down to buy cheaper groceries, raising concerns that they may hesitate to splurge on gifts, decor and other holiday items.\n\nParade of promos\nAs shoppers lounged at the pool and went on long-awaited vacations this summer, the drumbeat of promotions was already underway. More items were on sale during backyard barbecue season than during peak holiday season a year ago.\n\nDuring the second week of July, 46% of units were on promotion, according to the NPD Group. That’s higher than the 41% of units on promotion during the fourth week of November 2021 — the kickoff to the holiday shopping season.\n\nWhen Amazon threw its Prime Day in July, Walmart opted out of its own sales event because so much of its merchandise was already on sale.\n\nSales have picked up again in recent weeks, too. In October, Amazon threw a Prime Day-like sales event, the first time it has had two discount days in the same year. Target and Walmart got started early, too, with Target’s Deal Days running a week before the Amazon event and Walmart’s Rollback & More event overlapping with it.\n\nThis week, Walmart announced it will have savings events that kick off every Monday in November on its website and then continue in its stores. Customers who belong to its subscription service, Walmart+, will get access to hot deals and popular items seven hours early.\n\nPromotions will be especially pronounced in certain categories. Apparel and the sports and outdoors category have already had a noticeable jump in discounts at Walmart and Target compared with the year-ago period in September, according to YipitData, a research firm that collects data from consumer receipts and scrapes retailers’ websites.\n\nFor instance, at Walmart, apparel items sold at an approximately 20% discount, up from about 7% in 2021 for the two-week period ended Sept. 17. At Target, apparel items sold at an approximately 18% discount, up from about 4% in the year-ago period.\n\nBeauty, on the other hand, has had few discounts — which may reflect consumers’ willingness to keep spending on self-care or little luxuries like lipstick and lotion, even if budgets are tight in other areas. Discount levels across Ulta Beauty\n categories were either stable or down slightly year over year for the two weeks ended Sept. 17, YipitData found.\n\nThe level of discounting by retailers will also depend on their customer bases, said Numerator’s Feler. Dollar stores or other discounters, for instance, will need be more sensitive to consumers’ budget constraints. But luxury brands, which have higher-income customers, won’t have to adjust as much, with sales in the category remaining strong.\n\nFor shoppers like Rebecca Kirschner, the promotions over the past six months mark a welcome change. The New York City resident and her fiance just registered for their wedding, and nearly everything was on sale\n\nA year ago, she recalled shelves being emptier. This holiday season, she expects the money she spends on family and friends will go further.\n\n“It feels like you went from half a plate of food to a buffet,” said Kirschner, 33. “Every store you go into has a big sales section now.”",
